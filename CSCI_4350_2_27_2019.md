## Synthesized Attribute

* The value is calulated only in production where the symbol is on the LHS
* The flow of information in parse tree is bottom-up
* An S-attributed grammar only has synthesized attributes

## Inherited attribute

* The value is calculated only in productions where the symbol appears on the right hand side
* In this case the flow of information is going in th eother direction.
  * its not just from the top down
  * can also be left to right
    * get information from one of the symbols on the right
    * BUT flow can only go left to right
* An L-attributed grammar can contain both synthesized and inherited attributes but must be able to compute attributes in a single left to right depth first parse tree

## Example

```haskell
Expr -> num Expr`                     > Expr`.st = num.val
                                      > Expr.val = Expr`.val
Expr`_1 -> -num Expr`_2 | \epsilon    > Expr`_2.val = Expr`_1 - num.val
                                      > Expr`_1.val = Expr`_2.val
Expr`_1 -> \epsilon                   > Expr`.val = Expr`.st
```

## Ex - Parse Tree


## Semantic analysis during a parse

* Bottom-up parse would require an S-attributed grammar
* Top-down parse would require an L-attributed grammar
* A compiler that performs semantic analysis code during a parse is called a one pass compiler

## Semantic analysis after the parse

-> use attribute grammar to construct a syntax tree
