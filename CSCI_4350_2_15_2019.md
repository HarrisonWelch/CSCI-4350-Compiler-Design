## Closure (s)

* `s` = set of LR(1) items
* `\delta` = arbitrary following characters
* `*` (bullet) = the bullet is a placeholder. it is what we have processed already
* `C` = next to proces
* `\delta` is yet to process
* `\gamma` is other production

```c
closure (s)
  while (s is still chaning)
    for each item [A->B*C\delta, a] \in s
      for each production C -> \gamma \in P
        for each b \in FIRST(\delta`a`)
          S <- S \cup {[C->*\gamma, b]}
```

generate another parse tree

## Goto(s, x)

* `s` = set of items
* `x` = symbol

NOTE: The bullet moves over

```c
goto(s, x)
  moved <- \null
  for each item i \in s
    if the form of i is [ \alpha -> \beta * x \gamma, a ]
      moved <- moved \cup {[ \alpha -> \beta x * \gamma, a ]}
  return closure(moved)
```

## Algorithm to our table contruction

CC_0 <- closure({ [S' -> * S, eof ] })

* `S` is start symbol
* `S'` is new start symbol (cannot appear on the right side)

CC <- {CC_0}

* NOTE: Set of all our states

## 

```haskell
1. Goal -> List
2. List -> List Pair
3.      |  Pair
4. Pair -> ( Pair )
5.      | ( )
```

## CC_G

[Goal -> * List, eof]

* A is goal
* \beta is bullet
* List is C
* \delta is comma
* eof is a
* b is eof

FIRST(\delta a) = FIRST(eof) = {eof}

```haskell
[List -> * List Pair , eof]
[List -> * Pair , eof]
```

## Algorithm to our table contruction pt2

CC_0 <- closure({ [S' -> * S, eof ] })

CC <- {CC_0}

```c
while (new sets are still being added to CC)
  for each unmarked set CC_i \in CC
    mark CC_i as processed
    for each x following a '*' (bullet) in an item in CC_i
      temp <- goto(CC_i, x)
      if temp \in CC
        then CC <-  CC \cup {temp}
      record transition from CC_i to temp on x
```
