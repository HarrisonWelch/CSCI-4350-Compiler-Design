## Stack-based allocation

* A __Call Stack__ is a structure in memory made up of a stack of __frames__ or __activation records__
* When a subroutine is called, a new frame is pushed on top of the stack
* When the subroutine returns its frame is popped off of the stack
* A stack pointer register keeps track of the address at the top of the stack
* A __frame pointer__ (activation record pointer) keeps track of a location within the fream used as a base
  address for accessing the frame contents
* ARP - Activation refrence pointer, or Frame Pointer

## Frame contents

* The __Return address__ for the subroutine
  * -> instruction to jump to when the subroutine returns
* Miscellanious bookkeeping information
* Register contents
* Parameters
* local variables
* Return value

## Subroutines

NOTE: generally accepted non-precise thing for what we are talking about

* A subroutine performs an action on behalf of its __caller__
* The caller may provide __arguments__ or __actual parameters__
* The __actual parameters__ and are then bound to the subroutine's formal paramaters (or parameters)

## The __calling sequence__

* The __calling sequence__ is code executed by the caller before and after the subroutine call is executed


## The Caller does the following

1. Save __caller-saves__ registers whose values may be needed after the call
2. Computes the values of the arguments values of the arguments and stores then on the stack or in registers
3. Computes and stores the static link to the lexically surrounding subroutine if it exists
4. Jumps to the subroutine and stores the return address on the stack or in the register

## The callee then execures its prologue

1. Allocates a from on the stack
2. Saves and resplaces the old frame pointer
3. Saves callee-saves registers that may be overwritten by the current subroutine
