Talking about procedures and the like.

## THe callee then executes its __prologue__

1. Allocates a fram on the stack
2. Saves and replaces the old fram pointer
3. Saves callee-saves registers that may be overwritten by the current subroutine

## After the subroutine completes it executes its epilogue:

1. Stores the return value (if any) to a register or the stack
2. Restores callee-saves registers if needed
3. Restores the FP and SP
4. Jumps back to the return address

## Finally, the caller does the following

1. Moves the return value wherever it is needed
2. Restores caller-saves registers if needed

# Chapter 7: Code Shape

Ultimately we move toward generating target code. We need to focus on generating code in a 3-address structure

```
D -> T id ; D
  | \epsilon
T -> BC
  | record '{' D '}'
B -> int
  | float
C -> \epsilon
  | [num] C
```

## Declarations:

The __Width__ of a type is the amount of space (usually in byte) an object of that type takes up in memory
