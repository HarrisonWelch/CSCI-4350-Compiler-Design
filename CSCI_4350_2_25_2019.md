## Assignment Talk

Yes, it breaks down into if and for

(what is 'fi' keyword)

'fi' is a way to solve the dangling else, without an LR parser

* end of 'if' marker

## Type equivalence

* Determine if two different type declarations are equivalent
* Name equivalence - only types of the same name are equivalent
* structural equivalence - types of the same structure are equivalent

```c
struct foo {
  int x;
  int y;
}
```

```c
struct bar {
  int a;
  int b;
}
```

Type Inference

* can indentify when value must be coerced to another type before another operation can be performed
* can detect type errors if an operation is incompatible w/ types of operands
* declarations provide information about the types of idenifiers
* procedure calls can be analyzed using the type signature of a procedure
