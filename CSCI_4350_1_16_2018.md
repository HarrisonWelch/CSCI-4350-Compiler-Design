source code `->` front end `->` Intermediate Representation (IR) `->` back end `->` target

in reality the IR, also contains optimization

source code `->` front end `->` IR / Optimization `->` back end `->` target

Focus Areas:

1. Front End
2. Optimizer
3. Back End

IR can produce more IR, recursive as many times as one needs

```
a <- a x 2 x b x c x d
```

## Front End

Multple Phases

"syntax and symmantics"

1. Scanner
    1. Generate Tokens
    2. Diff between Int and Float
2. Parser
    1. grabs tokens as it needs to and makes sure they make sense, syntax sense
    2. match expectations with reality
3. Context sensitive analysis
    1. Has a variable been declared before used
4. Generate an IR (goal here)

"In reality, you have one big parser"

```psuedocode
a <- a x 2 x b x c x d

||
|| frontend
\/

t_0 <- a x 2
t_1 <- t_0 x b
t_2 <- t_1 x c
t_3 <- t_2 x d
a <- t_3
```

## Optimizer

(may) have Several diff passess where it does a variety of different things

`->` opt1 `->` opt2 `->` opt3 `->`

Transformation or rewriting of input

```
b <- ...
c <- ...
a <- 1

for i = 1 to n
  read d
  [a <- a x 2 x b x c x d ]
  end
```

`2 x b x c` never changes so this can be made a constant

Optimize to this:

```
b <- ...
c <- ...
a <- 1
t <- 2 x b x c

for i = 1 to n
  read d
  [a <- a x t x d ]
  end
```

## Back End

1. Instruction selection
    1. what instructions we are going to use for the orders given in IR
    2. code uses virtual registers
2. Register Allocation
    1. which registers to be used in what situations
3. Instruction Scheduling
    1. Ops can sometimes take a long time (high latency)
    2. This step minimizes time waiting for instructions to finish

loadAI, storeAI take 3 cycles

__Instruction Selection__

arp = activation record pointer

```
instruction                       | start | end |
loadAI  r_arp, @a   => r_a        | 1       3
loadI   2           => r_2        | 4       4
loadAI  r_arp, @b   => r_b        | 5       7
loadAI  r_arp, @c   => r_c        | 8       9
loadAI  r_arp, @d   => r_d        | 10      12
mult    r_a, r_2    => r_a        | 13      14
mult    r_a, r_b    => r_a        | 14      17
mult    r_a, r_c    => r_a        | 15      17
mult    r_a, r_d    => r_a        | 18      19      

storeAI r_a         => r_arp, @a  | 20      22
```

__Register Allocation__

```
instruction                       | start | end |
loadAI  r_arp, @a   => r_1          1       3
add     r_1, r_1    => r_1          2       4
loadAI  r_arp, @b   => r_2          3       5
mult    r_1, r_2    => r_1          4       4
loadAI  r_arp, @c   => r_2          5       6
mult    r_1, r_2    => r_1          6       
loadAI  r_arp, @d   => r_2
mult    r_1, r_2    => r_1
storeAI r_1         => r_arp, @a
```

__Instruction Scheduling__

```
loadAI  r_arp, @a   => r_1
loadAI  r_arp, @b   => r_2
loadAI  r_arp, @c   => r_3
add     r_1, r_1    => r_1
add     r_1, r_2    => r_1
loadAI  r_1, @d     => r_1
mult    r_1, r_3    => r_1
mult    r_1, r_2    => r_1
storeAI r_1         => r_arp, @a
```
