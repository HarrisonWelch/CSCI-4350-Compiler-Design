Scanner

* Must determine when 1 token ends and another begins
* It must also determine what category of token

## Categories

* Identifier
* Keyword
* Literals
* Operators
* Delimiters

## Finite automaton (FA)

1. S = a set of states including an error state S_e (S subscript e)
2. \Sigma = the __alphabet__ of characters
    1. all characters we want to recognize
3. \delta(s,c) = __the transition function__
    1. s is a member of S (s is a state)
    2. c is a member of \Sigma
    3. produces s' which is a member of S
    4. "follow a transition to s' "
4. s_0 (s sub zero) = the start state
5. S_A is a subset of S = the accepting states

```
S = { s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_e }
\Sigma = { e,h,i,l,w }
\delta(s_0, w) = s_1
\delta(s_1, h) = s_2
...
\delta(s_i, c) = s_e
\\ where s_i, c are any
```

## Example

<,>, <=, =>, !=, ==

```
start -> s_e -`<`-> s_l (accepting)     -`=`-> s_5 (accepting)
start -> s_e -`!`-> s_n (not accepting) -`=`-> s_5 (accepting)
start -> s_e -`>`-> s_n (accepting)     -`=`-> s_5 (accepting)
start -> s_e -`=`-> s_n (not accepting) -`=`-> s_5 (accepting)
```

## Example

```
Start -> s_0 --a-z,A-Z--> s_1 --0-9,a-z,A-Z--> s_1 (cycle for endlessness)
```
