Induction proofs, proof by construction, Dr. Coleman's thesis

## A Context Free grammar (CFG)

* A set `T` of __terminal symbols__
* A set of `NT` of __nonterminal symbols__
* A nonterminal `S \in NT` used as the start symbol
* A set `P` of productions
  * `NT` -> `(T \or NT)*`

## Example 

```
Expr -> (Expr)
      | Expr Op id
      | id
Op   -> +|-|x|/
```

## Derivations

A __Derivation__ uses a grammars productions of a grammar to show a string of terminal symbols belongs to the language defined by that grammar

* Start with the start symbol
* Each step a production `A` -> `\alpha` to replace a nonterminal `A` with a sequence of symbols `\alpha`.
* The current set of symbols is called a __sentential form__
* Ends when sentential form is a string of terminal
  * go until everything is in a terminal state
  * the end state is called the yeild

## Examples of Derivations

Ex1) `(a + b) * c`

```
Expr  => Expr Op Id
      => (Expr) Op Id
      => (Id Op Id) Op Id
      => (Id + Id) Op Id
      => (Id + Id) * Id
```

NOTE: This is a __leftmost derivation__: replace the leftmost non-terminal

Now for Rightmost:

Ex1) `(a + b) * c`

```
Expr  => Expr Op Id
      => Expr * Id
      => (Expr) * Id
      => (Expr Op Id) * Id
      => (Expr + Id) * Id
      => (Id + Id) * Id
```

## Parse Trees

A __parse tree__ is a graphical representationof a derivation

```
            Expr
/                 |     \
Expr              Op  Id
/|\               |
(Expr)            x
/|\
(Expr Op Id)
  |   |
(Id   +  Id)
```

## Ambiguoity

A Grammar is __ambiguous__ if any string has more than one leftmost (or rightmost) derivation or parse tree

```
Statement -> If Expr then statement else statement
          | if Expr  then statement
          | if expr then statement
          | Assignment
          ...
```

How is this ambiguous

if Expr_1 then Expr_2 then Assignment_1 else Assignment_2
