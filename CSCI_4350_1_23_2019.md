## A regular lang is a set of strings accepted by a FA

* Regular languages can be specified by __regular expression__
  * What is a RegExpr or RE
  * Given an RE r, L(r) is the language it specifies
  * The symbol \epsilon represents a lang consistening of the empty string (a nothing)

Language of the empty string is simply the empty string

```
L( \epsilon ) = { \epsilon }
```

Language of a single character is simply the single character

```
L( a ) = { a }
```

Each one of those characters can be used to represent a language of just that

  * Given a \in \Sigma, L(a) = {a}
  * Given RE r, s the following are also REs
    * Alternation: L(r | s) = { x | x \in L(r) or x \in L(s) }

```
L( a | b ) = { a, b }
L( a | b | c | d ) = { a, b, c, d }
L( a | \epsilon ) = { a, \epsilon }
```

    * concatenation: L(rs) = { xy | x \in L(r) and y \in L(s) }

```
L( if | while | for | else ) = { if, while, for, else }
L( (a|b) cd ) = { acd, bcd }
```

    * Kleene closure: L(r*) = { x_1, x_2, ... x_n | n >= 0 and x_i and x \in L(r) }
    * L(a*) = { \epsilon, a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa, ... }

## Example of Kleene items

```
< | > | <= | >= | != | ==
<!-- goes to -->
(<|>) (=|\epsilon) | (!|=) =
```

But what about numbers (identification)

```
0 | (1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9) (0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)*
```

## Additional notation

  * brackets [0...9] reps decimal digits
```
0 | [1...9][0...9]*
```
  * also with letters [a...z] is lowercase and [A...Z] is uppercase
```
([a...z]|[A...Z]) ([a...z]|[A...Z]|[0...9])*
```
  * r^+ (r with superscript plus) represents concatinations of one or more string L(r)
  * r^n (r with superscript "n") represents concatinations of one to n string L(r)
```
L(a^4) = { a, aa, aaa, aaaa }
```
  * ^c specifies the set \Sigma - {c}; implies Sigma is defined first (otherwise...Logic?)
```
"(^")*"
<!-- any number of characters that are not double-quotes -->
```

## Closure properties

* The union of two RL is a RL (RL = regular language)
* The concatenation of two RLs is an RL
* The Kleene closure of an RL is an RL
* The compliment of a regular language is a regular language is a regular language
* The intersection of two RLs is a RL
