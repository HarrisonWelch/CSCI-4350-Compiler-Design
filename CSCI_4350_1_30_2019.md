## Off topic conversation about proofs

The sum of two odd numbers is even

odd: 2n+1 where n \in Z
even: 2n where n \in Z

assume m,n are odd

m = 2j+1 for some k \in Z
n = 2k+1 for some j \in Z

m + n = (2j + 1) + (2k + 1)
      = 2j + 2k + 2
      = 2(j + k + 1)

m + n is even

## Hand-coded scanners

* Input buffering imporve performance of reading characters and rolling back to an earlier position in the input
* Token values for numbers can be built incrementally

## Keywords

* hand-coded scanner-classify keywords as identifiers, then use a hash table of all keywords to distinguish them
  * helpful to have a small number of keywords
  * each keywords adds more compute time

## A Parser

A parser reads a stream of tokens and determines the syntatic structure of the program

* phrase level syntax
* The syntax rules are specified using a __grammar__
* If the program violates these rules, the parser generates parse errors
* If the program follows the rules, the parser builds a structured model of the program

```c
x * (y + z)
id - identifier
op - operator

id(op id)*

(* id )* ( op (* id )* )*

// this where we reach the limit of regular expression
// regular expressions cannot count
```
