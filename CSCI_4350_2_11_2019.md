## Parsers!

### An __LR(1) grammar__ has the following properties

* It can be used to process tokens in __L__ eft-to-right order
* The parse follows a __R__ ightmost derivation in reverse order
* Only __1__ token of lookahead is required to determine which production to use
* No backtracking is required

### Facts about LR1 parsers

Venn Diagram

* context-free langs
  * LR(1) langs
    * LL(1) langs
      * regular languages (accepted by DFA, NFA, regular expression)

## LR(1) parsing

* When a new token is read the parser shifts that token onto the stack
* The parser keeps shiting until it has assembled a __handle__ - a string of symbols that appears on the RHS of production
* When a handle is assembled, the __reduces__ it by popping the RHS form the stack and replacing it with the LHS
* "The stack is for accumulating symbols"
* "grouped into groups using right hand derivations"
* "start with leaves as right hand"
* When the stack contains the start symbol you are done.

### A table-driven LR(1) parsing alg

* requires tables, 2 in particular
* The rows are indexed by states
* The current state is used to determine what to do next
* The 1st table is whats called the action table
* The columns of action table are indexed by terminal symbols, and the entries represent.
* Four kinds of entries
  * A shift action - move token onto stack; changing to new state
  * A reduce action - results in popping an RHS from the stack and pushing the corresponding LHS onto the stack
  * An accept action - The parse was successful
    * "If we hit that point we are done"
  * An error action - something went wrong; reports parse error.
* The GoTo table
* The columns of the goto table are indexed by non-terminal symbols
