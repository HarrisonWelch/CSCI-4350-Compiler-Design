Performing a parse

```
Goal -> Expr
Expr  -> Expr + Term
      -> Expr - Term
      -> Term
Term  -> Term * Factor
      -> Term / Factor
      -> Factor
Factor  -> (Expr)
        | id
        | num
```

## Build a parse tree

Top down and bottom up

We have a goal and an expression we need to use to get to a goal

```
Goal

????? stuff and things ?????

<id, a> + <id, b> * <id, c>
```

1st lets try top-to-bottom

## Top-to-Bottom

```
Goal
|
Expr
```

Then

```
Goal
|
Expr
/|\
Expr + Term
```

Then, blowout the first expr

```
Goal
|
Expr
          /|\
Expr      +      Term
/|\
Expr + Term
```

problem of this blowing up when blindly picking the first productions

We could add heuristic, but that would be fruitless

We need information about where we want to go to

We could replace left recursion with right recursion. Always possible to take left and make it right

## Okay now this to fix said probs

```
Goal  -> Expr (if wanting to be precise use EOF symbol)
Expr  -> Term Expr'               {(, id, num}
Expr' -> + Term Expr'             {+}
      -> - Term Expr'             {-}
      -> \epsilon (empty string)  {/0}
Term  -> Factor Term'             {(, id, num}
      -> * Term Factor'           {*}
      -> / Term Factor'           {/}
      -> \epsilon (empty string)  {/0}
Factor  -> ( Expr )               {(}
        -> id                     {id}
        -> num                    {number}
```

```
Goal
|
Expr
/\
Term                              Expr'
/\                                /|\
Factor       Term'            + Term Expr'
|           |                    /\         \
<id, a>     \epsilon         Factor Term'   \epsilon
                                |    /\ --------\
                          +   <id,b> * Factor   Term'
                                        |         |
                                      <id, c>   \epsilon
```

## Example

```
S -> aB | aC
  |
S -> aA
A -> B
  | C
```

We have a problem. Based on the what the next token is, which production we are at

## LL(1) grammar

* Left-to-Right through the tokens
* Leftmost derivation
* 1 token of look ahead
