A __compiler__ is a computer program that that transalates other computer program from one language to another.

## Variations

* traditional compiler:
  * High level `->` __compiler__ `->` assembly
* Experimental compiler:
  * High level languaga `->` __compiler__ `->` C or other language
* Java and C#
  * "Speaking of byte code"
  * "Allow code to run anywhere"
  * High level languaga `->` __compiler__ `->` byte code `->` interpreted on a virtual machine
* Just-in-time compilation
  * bytecoder `->` compiler `->` machine code

## Interpreters

* high-level language & input `->` __interpreter__ `->` output

## Why study compilers

* good software engineering exercise
* draws on many different areas of Computer Science
  * algorithms
  * automata
  * math concepts
  * programming
  * etc.
* correctness and efficiency of the code generated impacts computer system
* apply theory to practical problems
* still room for improvement

## Fundamental principles of compilation

1. The compiler must preserve the meaning of the program compiled
2. The compiler must improve the input program in some discernable way
