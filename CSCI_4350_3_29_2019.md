## Control Flow Graphs

* How to build a CFG (Control Flow Graph):
  1. partition the intermediate code into **basic blocks**: The largest sequence of instructions with the following properties:
      1. There are no jumps to any instructions other than the first instruction in the block
      2. There are no jumps from any instructions in the block other than the last instruction in the block
  2. The basic blocks make up the vertices in the control flow graph in the CFG whose edge indicate which blocks can follow other blocks

  ```
      i=1
  L1: j=1
  L2: t1 = 10 * j
      t2 = t1 + j
      t3 = 8 * t2
      t4 = t3 - 88
      a[t4] = 0.0
      j = j + 1
      if j <= 10 goto L2
      i = i+1
      if i<=20 goto L1
      i = 1
  L3: t5 = i - 1
      t6 = 88 * t5
      a[t6] = 1.0
      i = i + 1
      if i <= 10 goto L3
