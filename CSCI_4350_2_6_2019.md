For a sequence of symbols \beta, FIRST(\beta) is a set containing the first terminal symbol of any possible yeild of a derivation starting from \beta

* FIRST(\epsilon) = \null
* FIRST(a\alpha) = {a} for any terminal a, sequence of symbols
* FIRST(A\alpha) = the union of every FIRST set of an RHS of a production whose LHS is A, along with FIRST(\alpha) if \epsilon can be derived from A.

Factor is always going to generate a string at least 1 character

Ulitmately what we want are predict sets

For a nonterminal symbol A, FOLLOW(A) is a set containing a terminal symbol that can follow A in a sentential form

* Yeild is the sentence, sentential form contains nonterminals.
* EOF \in FOLLOW(S)
* For any production B -> \alpha A B, all terminals in the first set FIRST(\beta) should be added to the follow set FOLLOW(A)
* If \epsilon can be derived from \beta, then all terminals in the follow set of B `FOLLOW(B)` should also be added to the follow set of A.

FOLLOW(A)

{EOF}

For a production A -> \beta PREDICT(A->B) is the set of tokens that should trigger the application of that production when current symbol is A.

* All terminals in FIRST(\beta) should be added to the predict set `PREDICT(A->B)`
* If \epsilon can be derived from \beta, all terminals in `FOLLOW(A)` should be added to `PREDICT(A->B)`

## LL(1) parser

1. A handwritten recursive descent parser
2. Automatically generated parse table; an LL(1) parse table used with a generic driver program

## Recursive descent parser

1. For each nonterminal symbol
    1. Write a procedure that applies productions `A->B`
2. In each procedure, write a case/switch statement that checks the current input token
3. If the current input token can be used to predict a production
4. Otherwise report a parse error
