## Declarations

The width of a type is the amount of space (usually in bytes) an object of that type takes up in memory.

## Arrays

```
A[i]
```

* What A is
  * content type
  * where

1. Base Address

```
A[i] => base
```

2. We need the i, the index address

```
A[i] => base + i * w
```

* i is index
* w is size of the section

```
A[i_1][i_2] => base + i_1 * w_1 + i_2 * w_2
```

* i_1 is index 1
* i_2 is index 2
* w_1 is size of the column
* w_1 is size of the element (width)

## kth dimension chunk

```
A[i_1]...[i_k] => base + i_1 * w_1 + ... + i_k * w_k
```

Factor stuff out (says the teacher)

```
base + (( ... (i_1 * n_2 + i_1)*n_3 + i _3 ) ... ) * n_k + i_k) * w
```

That's what we need to facilitate multi dimensional arrays. Let's see how to do this with our regular grammar

```
S -> L = E;         { gen(L.array.base) '[' L.addr ']' '=' E.addr); }
E -> L
L -> id [ E ]
  -> L_1 [ E ]
```
