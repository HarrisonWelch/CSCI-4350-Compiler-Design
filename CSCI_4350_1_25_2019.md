RE = reg expr

FA = finite automaton

## RE -> FA

1. Build a nondeterministic FA (NFA) from the RE
2. Convert NFA to a determinisitic FA (DFA)
3. Minimize the DFA so it contains as few states as possible

## NFA

An NFA is an FA where there may be mulitple paths for any given string

* A transition labelled with an \epsilon can be followed without consuming input
  * "What do you mean by comsuming input?

  ```
  start s_0 -> s_1 -b-> s_2
  ```

  ```
  start s_0 --\epsilon--> s_1 -b-> s_2
  <!-- this work without advancing forward -->
  ```

  * There may be more than one transition from a given state that is labelled with the same character
  * There may be no transition from a given state this labelled with a particular character
  * A string is accepted by an NFA iff there is some path that consumes the string and ends up in a comsuming state
    * grep, does this. turn into NFA and then do its job

## DFA

A DFA is an FA where there is exactly one path for any given string.

* For each state `s` and each character there is exactly one transition from `s` and labelled with a `c`
* \epsilon-transitions are NOT allowed
* Every DFA is also an NFA (with above restrictions)
* For every NFA, a DFA can be constructed that accepts/recognizes the same language
